# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive file upload policies and validations for the TODO application. The system currently supports file uploads during user registration (profile images) and TODO item creation (attachments), but lacks proper validation, size limits, and security restrictions. This enhancement will add robust file upload policies to ensure security, performance, and user experience standards.

## Glossary

- **File_Upload_System**: The backend file upload handling system using Multer and TypeORM
- **Profile_Image_Upload**: File upload functionality during user registration for profile pictures
- **Todo_Attachment_Upload**: File upload functionality when creating or editing TODO items
- **File_Size_Validator**: Component that validates uploaded file sizes against defined limits
- **File_Type_Validator**: Component that validates uploaded file types against allowed/blocked extensions
- **Frontend_Upload_Interface**: React components handling file selection and upload UI

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all file uploads to be limited to 10MB maximum size, so that server storage and bandwidth are protected from abuse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads any file, THE File_Upload_System SHALL validate the file size before processing
2. IF a file exceeds 10MB, THEN THE File_Upload_System SHALL reject the upload and return an error message
3. THE Frontend_Upload_Interface SHALL display the file size limit to users before upload
4. THE File_Size_Validator SHALL apply consistently to both Profile_Image_Upload and Todo_Attachment_Upload

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user registering an account, I want to upload only image files as my profile picture, so that the system maintains visual consistency and security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Profile_Image_Upload SHALL accept only a single file per upload
2. THE File_Type_Validator SHALL allow only image file extensions: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .webp
3. IF a non-image file is selected, THEN THE Frontend_Upload_Interface SHALL prevent upload and display an error message
4. THE Profile_Image_Upload SHALL validate file type on both frontend and backend
5. WHEN an invalid file type is uploaded, THE File_Upload_System SHALL reject the file and return a descriptive error

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user creating TODO items, I want to attach multiple relevant files, so that I can organize supporting documents with my tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Todo_Attachment_Upload SHALL support multiple file selection and upload
2. THE File_Type_Validator SHALL allow common office and document file extensions: .xlsx, .pptx, .docx, .pdf, .hwp, .txt
3. THE Todo_Attachment_Upload SHALL display selected files with their names and sizes before upload
4. WHEN multiple files are selected, THE File_Upload_System SHALL validate each file individually
5. THE Frontend_Upload_Interface SHALL allow users to remove individual files from selection before upload

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want dangerous executable files to be blocked from upload, so that the system is protected from malicious file uploads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE File_Type_Validator SHALL block executable and script file extensions: .exe, .js, .msi, .bat, .sh, .cmd, .vbs
2. IF a blocked file type is selected, THEN THE Frontend_Upload_Interface SHALL immediately prevent upload and show security warning
3. THE File_Upload_System SHALL maintain a server-side blocklist validation as a security backup
4. WHEN a blocked file is attempted for upload, THE File_Upload_System SHALL log the security event
5. THE File_Type_Validator SHALL apply blocked extensions to both Profile_Image_Upload and Todo_Attachment_Upload

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback about file upload restrictions and progress, so that I understand what files I can upload and track upload status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Frontend_Upload_Interface SHALL display file size limits and allowed file types prominently
2. WHEN files are selected, THE Frontend_Upload_Interface SHALL show file validation status for each file
3. THE Frontend_Upload_Interface SHALL display upload progress indicators during file transfer
4. IF validation fails, THEN THE Frontend_Upload_Interface SHALL show specific error messages explaining the restriction
5. WHEN upload completes successfully, THE Frontend_Upload_Interface SHALL confirm successful upload with file details
