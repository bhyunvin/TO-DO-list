# Preloads for root-level execution (pointing to client check works)
# If user runs `bun test` from root, we need to load the environment.
# Assuming typical monorepo structure where client tests need dom.
preload = ["./client/src/setupTests.ts"]
# dom = "happy-dom"

[test.env]
# Shared test environment variables can go here
